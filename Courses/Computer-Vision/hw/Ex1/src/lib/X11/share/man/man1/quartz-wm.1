.Sh NAME
.Nm quartz-wm
.Nd Aqua Window Manager for the X Window System on OS X
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -prefs-domain Ar domain
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a window manager for the X Window System. It provides titlebars for 
X11 windows that aim to match the look and feel of native
.Ar Mac OS X
windows.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -prefs-domain Ar domain
This option can be used to override the domain used to read preferences
from.  This is useful if you want to have multiple X11.apps running at
the same time.
.El
.Sh CUSTOMIZATION
.Nm
can be customized using the
.Xr defaults 1
command.  Examples are shown using the default org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 domain.  If you
use another domain (either through the X11_PREFS_DOMAIN environment
variable or the --prefs-domain command line argument), then you need
to substitute that instead.
.Nm
can be forced to re-read these preferences by sending it a SIGHUP using 
.Xr kill 1 .
.Pp
The available options are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_ffm -bool true
Enables focus-follows-mouse mode. Windows belonging to the X server may
then be focused by moving the pointer over them, as well as the default
mode of clicking in them.
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_click_through -bool true
Disables the default behavior of swallowing window-activating mouse events.
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_limit_size -bool true
Limit the size of each window to the size of the current head.
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.x11 wm_focus_on_new_window -bool false
Don't tell X11.app to take focus when a new X11 window is created.
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_window_shading -bool true
Enables double clicking on a titlebar to shade the window
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_auto_quit -bool true
Automatically quit
.Nm
(thus shutting down the X11 server) when the last window is closed.
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_auto_quit_timeout -int 3
Set the timeout for the auto-quit feature.  If wm_auto_quit is true, quartz-wm
will wait this many seconds before attempting to shutdown.  If another window
is created in that time, quartz-wm will not shutdown.
.It defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 wm_show_shortcut -bool true
Show each window's key equivalent, if it has one, in its title bar.
.El
.Sh LOGGING
.Pp
quartz-wm sends messages to
.Xr syslogd 8
using
.Xr asl 3 .
These logs are sent to the org.macosforge.xquartz facility, and you can watch
these logs using the following
.Xr syslog 1
command:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It $ syslog -w -k Facility eq org.macosforge.xquartz
.El
.Pp
By default, debugging logs are filtered out.  You can adjust the filter to
print debugging information for the running quartz-wm with this
.Xr
syslog 1
command
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It $ syslog -c quartz-wm -d
.El
.Pp
See
.Xr syslog 1
or
.Xr asl 3
for more information on syslog filtering.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It DISPLAY
This variable is used to determine which X server to use.
.It X11_PREFS_DOMAIN
This variable is used as Ar domain if the Fl -prefs-domain command line option
is not given.  If neither Fl -prefs-domain nor X11_PREFS_DOMAIN are set, then
the default value of org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 is used instead.
.It DEBUG
If this variable is set, debug logging will be printed to stderr in addition to asl.
