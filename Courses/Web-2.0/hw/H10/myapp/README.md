###My app
This server must be run under Windows systems.</br>
Your computer should install mongodb to support our database.</br>
Then click server.bat you will run the server and see:</br>
  <pre> "Mongoose connected to mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/AccountData"</pre>
Also, the database server is unstable, so sometimes you will be fail to connect</br>
to connect to the mongodb server, but my server will try connected again.
